MazeSolvingRobotAlgorithm
=========================

I wrote this application to visually simulate how different algorithms would behave when solving a maze. I only had time to implement one algorithm but nonetheless, the framework was there for others. The visual portion is was used for presentation. Developed this for Concordia COEN390 course.
